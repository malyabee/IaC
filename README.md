# IaaC - Infrastructure as a code 

This project host differt cluster environments (Infrasturcture as a Code) for Learn and Development.


In this project you can find multiple Vagrantfiles to setup different dev environments based on "centos/7"
All these Vagrant files configured  virtualbox as a provider. 


Install virtual box from (https://www.virtualbox.org)
Install vagrant  from  (https://www.vagrantup.com)

You can run Vagrant, Virtualbox on MacOS, Windows and Linux.

suspend         suspends the machine
up              starts and provisions the vagrant environment

version         prints current and latest Vagrant version
```

To start a VM:

```
vagrant up [<vm name>]
```

To connect to a VM:

```
vagrant ssh [<vm name>]
```

To reboot a VM:

```
vagrant reload [<vm name>]
```

**Note:** Don't reboot a VM from within the guest shell. Always use the `vagrant reload` command from the host. Rebooting from within the guest invalidates the SSH configuration and will prevent a connection being made on the next boot.

To get the current status of all VMs in a project:

```
vagrant status
```

To suspend the VM:

```
vagrant suspend
```

To restore a suspended VM:

```
vagrant resume
```

To review the SSH configuration that was used to establish a connection, run this command from the project directory:

```
vagrant ssh-config [<vm name>]
```

To tear down and delete the VM:

```
vagrant destroy [-f]
```

To get a list of forwarded ports on each host, run:

```
vagrant port <vm name>
```
